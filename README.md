# Mr-Chromebox

welcome the first thing we're going to need to do is turn on developer mode and turn off OS verification 

you can search up how to do this as this guy is just telling you what to do and not instructions

here's a photo of what this should look like ![IMG_3464](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdbb6660-0f32-49d8-bc41-23e0543d61cc)

Go through the standard Chrome OS login screen (you'll need to setup a network, etc) and get to the web browser. It's OK if you login as guest. Press [ Ctrl ] [ Alt ] [ T ] to get the [ crosh ] shell. Use the shell command to get the shell prompt.

root should be the login when it prompts you too
